### Tensorboard Plots
Use `tensorboard --logdir ./logs` to open tensorboard webserver, and go in **Scalars** tab
- Note: it plots all the data it finds in the log folder (events.out.tfevents* files), these are not deleted after every training so you'll see everything together, consider deleting them or look at the plots with Relative or Wall format
